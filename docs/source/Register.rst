Creating an Account
=====

Our platform is designed in such a way that it doesn't matter if you're a brand, influencer, content creator or just an average Joe/Jane.
Anyone can register and everyone has the same functionalities at his/her disposal.
You can be a brand and an influencer with the same account, starting a campaign as a brand and at the same time create content for other brands just by flipping a switch.

Let me take you down the rabbithole and introduce you to our ever evolving platform.

It all starts with the....

Registration
------------

To be able to register for an account you'll need to be 16yrs or older.

At the moment of writing and for the purpose of the upcoming pre-sale and launch of our token, we've activated the Crypto market first.
We'll be activating more markets later this year.

Connect your Socialchannels
------------

Before you can make use of the platform as influencer or brand, you'll need to connect at least one social-channel.
At the moment of writing only Twitter is activated, eventually this will change later this year once development progresses.

On the Chirpley-platform you can be brand and influencer at the same time. The switch below your username controls in which role you currently are.
In each role you can connect different social-channels and choose different market-niches.
