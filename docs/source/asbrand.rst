Set content and create deals
----------------

For the services you've chosen during the creation of the campaign content needs to be set.

On the left you'll find all the services in your campaign. By clicking on them, the service will open in the center of the screen.


Here you'll find cards which represent matching influencers which might perform the services for you. In this stage all influencers are anonymous.
The number and type of the shown influencers is roughtly based on the budget available for that particular service.
The final number of influencers accepting your deal might vary due to the value of each influencer.

In the top of the centerview you can see a selection of filters which you can use to show different type of cards.(set content, content set etc.)
Until an influencer has accepted a deal, all the shown cards are anonymous except for favorites.

To add favorites to a service, just click on the button "Add Favorites".
This will open a pop-up where your can select your personal favorites to be added to the current service.

Once you select a card in the center of the screen, you'll be able to set the content for these cards in a form on the rightside. This can be done one by one or in batch. The questions in the form are related to the service you're working on. 
Below you will find an overview of the questions per servicetype.


============  ==========
Service type  Form Items
============  ==========
Like          URL of post to liked.
Follow        URL of profile to be followed.
Retweet       URL of tweet to be shared.
Comment       - URL of tweet to be commented on.

              - content of comment(fix content,change in own-words,write based on instructions).
Tweet         - Content of tweet(fix content,change in own-words,write based on instructions)

              - Media if service is of this type. 
Quote         - URL of tweet to be shared.

              - content of quote(fix content,change in own-words,write based on instructions).
              - Media if service is of this type. 
============  ==========

When you're setting the content for comments, tweets or quotes you can choose between 3 options.

- Influencer cannot change text. (message should be sent as is)

- Influencer is required to put the text in their own words.

- Influencer writes own content based on text/announcement from brand.


With the first option the brand writes the content and the influencer has to accept the deal as is.
With the second option, the brand writes the content but the influencer has to rewrite it in their own words and with the final option the brand only gives instructions to the influencer on where to write about, this can be an article, product, event etc.

With the second and third option the brand will be able to review the content written by the influencer. As soon as both parties agree and accept the content the deal is final.

The service-budget will be divided over the different options used in the form. Say you have set 25% of the cards with the first content-option and 75% with the the second,
the budget get divided between these accordingly. 




Invite Influencers
------------

Once you've set all cards for a particular service you'll be able to invite all influencers matching this service.
By clicking on the "Send Invite" button in the right-menu, all matching influencers will be invited to perform the selected service.

Because influencers are limited to a fixed number of deals per campaign, we recommend you to first set the content of all services 
and combine the invites of different services (example: like, comment & retweet)
This way the influencer can make a clear choice on which service they want to perform.

  :alt: Invite matched influencers

  Click on the "Send Invite" button to invite the influencers.


After you've send out the invites, the matching influencers will receive the invitations in their mailbox and as an on-platform notification.
At this point all we need to do is wait until the budget of the service is filled with accepted deals.

  After sendiong the invite you can see how far the budget for each service is filled. 



Review Content

For content written by the influencers you will receive an review request. 


   
Accept Deals
------------

For influencers a twitter-account needs to have a minumum of 100 followers and atleast 20 own tweets.(retweets and replies are excluded) to be able to connect your Twitter)
The moment you've connected your social-media account with the platform, our automated system calculates the value of your account based the content.

You're able to adjust these values by 10%.
