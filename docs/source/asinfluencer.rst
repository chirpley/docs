  Where one grows, all grow together as a flock.


The Chirpley platform focusses especially on nano and micro-influencers. We believe the message of many is stronger than the power of one.
Therefor the platform has been developed to be as welcoming as possible, with an eye for the new born chicks, and the established influencer as well.

Where one grows, all grow together as a flock.

At the bottom of your business card, incase we could gather enough data, you can find detailed information about your audience.

Be sure to share your public profile-page so you'll get noticed by brands.


Referral Link
------------

We've something called the lifelong referral bonus.
How it works: you'll receive a stunning 20% of the Chirpley fees (which is 10% of each transaction) paid by anyone who creates an account on Chirpley using your personal referral link.

This means that if you have 5 referees who participate on the same campaign and each earn $100, you'll receive $10 (20% of their 10% fees) by doing absolutely nothing.

Your referral link starts with "https://app.chirpley.ai/Account/Register?referral=........" and can be found on your account-page.



Receiving Invites
------------

To be able to receive invites to campaigns you must have at least 20 followers and have active services in your connected channels.

It depends on the number available influencers in the selected market-niche and the available service-budget, how fast an influencer must react on the invite.

At the moment of writing and for the purpose of the upcoming pre-sale and launch of our token, we've activated the Crypto market first.
We'll be activating more markets later this year.

Communicate with Brand
------------

Before you can make use of the platform as influencer or brand, you'll need to connect at least one social-channel.
All your account-settings as brand of influencer can be set and edited from your profile-page.(https://app.chirpley.ai/Account/Profile)
At the moment of writing only Twitter is activated, eventually this will change later this year once development progresses.

On the Chirpley-platform you can be brand and influencer at the same time. The switch below your username controls in which role you currently are.
In each role you can connect different social-channels and choose different market-niches.

For influencers a twitter-account needs to have a minumum of 100 followers and atleast 20 own tweets.(retweets and replies are excluded) to be able to connect your Twitter)
