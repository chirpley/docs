Welcome to Chirpley's documentation!
===================================

**Chirpley** (/tʃəːp liː/) 

1. A little red bird which makes a short, sharp, high-pitched sound.

2. A talking red/yellow Zoobles figurine #155.

3. The world’s first automated, peer-to-peer, all-in-one influencer marketplace specifically focussed on nano and micro influencers.

Chirpley will provide marketers with the freedom to act fast and effective, thanks to the possibility of a 1-click marketing bomb.

Check out the :doc:`Introduction` section for further information, including
