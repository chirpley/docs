We believe everyone has influence and influences their own social environment, therefor everyone has an influential marketing value.

How much do I get paid on Chirpley?
------------

Our platform is completely automated and relies on A.I. to calculate someones IVM (Influencer Media Value).
Because we're still in early stage, we're gathering a lot of data which we use for fine-tuning and adjusting the algorithms.
Obviously we won't let anyone take a peak under the hood but believe us... The engine sounds fantastic.

Which Social media Channels are available?
------------

Because we're still in an early testing stage we've chosen to launch the platform with only Twitter as social platform.
This way we've been able to focus our development on the backend of our platform to make it robust and ready for the future. 
Later this year we'll add more social-media channels like Instagram, Tiktok, Facebook etc.

When will the platform expand to other markets beside Crypto/blockchain? 
------------

The reason we've chosen to start with the crypto/blockchain market is quite obvious, we're partly a crypto-project ourselves.
Therefor we made the decision to use the crypto-market as a testing ground so to speak. After the launch of our own token we will open up more and more markets.
