What are the requirements to become an influencer on Chirpley?
------------

We believe everyone has influence and influences their own social environment, therefor everyone has an influential marketing value.
Unfortunately, due to strict privacy-laws in some parts of the world, you have to be at least 16yr old.

How much do I get paid on Chirpley?
------------

Our platform is completely automated and relies on A.I. to calculate someones IVM (Influencer Media Value).
Because we're still in early stage, we're gathering a lot of data which we use for fine-tuning and adjusting the algorithms.
Obviously we won't let anyone take a peak under the hood but believe us... The engine sounds fantastic.

How do you valuate social-media accounts?
------------

To have a fair distribution of campaign-budgets the platform only valuates accounts on their organic engagement and impressions.
The system scans accounts and analyses the content and followers.
If the platform finds engagement to be non-organic the content is excluded from valuation.

Reasons for the algorithm to find engagement to be non-organic are:
- Engagement through giveaways.

- Like and retweet requests from external sources.

- Unexplainable high engagement-rates.

- Irregularities in engagement.

- Engagement from low-quality accounts (in-active, bots or fake).


If the platform can't valuate a Twitter-account, the user will receive a base fee.
If there's any doubt on the authenticity of an account, the staff has the right to put the user back to basic of block completely.

I participated in a campaign but I didn't receive any payment in my wallet.
------------


Once you've accepted a deal in a campaign, your earnings are held in escrow until the deal is completed.
The moment the deal is completed, payments are being made. This can take up to 1hr for it to be visible in your wallet.

However if you believe you didn't receive any payments for your service, please contact support@chirpley.ai with a screenshot of the campaign with the completed deal.

I've made a withdraw but I can't see it in my wallet?
------------


For the development-stage of the platform we've chosen to accept BNB for depositing campaign-funds, however all withdraws are currently in BUSD.
In case you don't have BUSD setup in your wallet, please do so as you won't be able to see the balance.
However if you believe your funds are missing, please contact support@chirpley.ai.

Which Social media Channels are available?
------------

Because we're still in an early testing stage we've chosen to launch the platform with only Twitter as social platform.
This way we've been able to focus our development on the backend of our platform to make it robust and ready for the future. 
Later this year we'll add more social-media channels like Instagram, Tiktok, Facebook etc.

When will the platform expand to other markets beside Crypto/blockchain? 
------------

The reason we've chosen to start with the crypto/blockchain market is quite obvious, we're partly a crypto-project ourselves.
Therefor we made the decision to use the crypto-market as a testing ground so to speak. After the launch of our own token we will open up more and more markets.
