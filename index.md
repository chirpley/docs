**Chirpley** (/tʃəːp liː/)

1.  A little red bird which makes a short, sharp, high-pitched sound.
2.  A talking red/yellow Zoobles figurine \#155.
3.  The world's first automated, peer-to-peer, all-in-one influencer
    marketplace specifically focussed on nano and micro influencers.

Chirpley will provide marketers with the freedom to act fast and
effective, thanks to the possibility of a 1-click marketing bomb.

Check out the `Introduction`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} section for
further information, including how to `use`{.interpreted-text
