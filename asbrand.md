### Set content and create deals

For the services you have chosen during the creation of the campaign
content needs to be set.

On the left you will find all the services in your campaign. By clicking
on them, the service will open in the center of the screen. In the top
of the center-view you can see a selection of filters which you can use
to show different type of cards. (Set content, content set etc.)

<div class="thumbnail" width="600" data-align="center" alt="Service Tabs" data-show_caption="True" title="">

\_static/images/service-header.png

Deals have different statuses during the runtime of the campaign. By
clicking on the filters, deals with that status will be loaded in the
grid below.

</div>

By default, the filter "Set content" is activated. Until an influencer
has accepted a deal, all the shown cards are anonymous except for
favorites.

<div class="thumbnail" width="600" data-align="center" alt="Service Tabs" data-show_caption="True" title="">

\_static/images/cards-anon.png

Anonymous cards

</div>

To add favorites to a service, just click on the button "Add Favorites".
This will open a pop-up where you can select your personal favorites to
be added to the current service.

<div class="thumbnail" width="500" data-align="center" alt="Favorites" data-show_caption="True" title="">

\_static/images/deals-fav.png

At your personal favorites to the campaign.

</div>

The shown cards under "Set Content", "Content Set" and "Invited"
represent matching influencers which might perform the services for you.
The number and type of the shown influencers is based on the budget
available for that service. The final number of influencers accepting
your deal might vary due to the value of each influencer.

<div class="thumbnail" width="600" data-align="center" alt="Like deals" data-show_caption="True" title="">

\_static/images/deals-like.png

View of the like service with 8 selected cards.

</div>

Once you select a card in the center of the screen, you'll be able to
set the content for these cards in a form on the right side. This can be
done one by one or in batch. The questions in the form are related to
the service you're working on. Below you will find an overview of the
questions per service-type.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Service type</th>
<th>Form Items</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Like</td>
<td>URL of post to liked.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Follow</td>
<td>URL of profile to be followed.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Retweet</td>
<td>URL of tweet to be shared.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Comment</p></td>
<td><ul>
<li>URL of tweet to be commented on.</li>
<li>content of comment (fix content,change in own-words,write based on instructions).</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Tweet</p></td>
<td><ul>
<li>Content of tweet (fix content,change in own-words,write based on instructions)</li>
<li>Media if service is of this type.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Quote</p></td>
<td><ul>
<li>URL of tweet to be shared.</li>
<li>content of quote (fix content,change in own-words,write based on instructions).</li>
<li>Media if service is of this type.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

When you are setting the content for comments, tweets or quotes you can
choose between 3 options.

  - Influencer cannot change text. (Message should be sent as is)
  - Influencer is required to put the text in their own words.
  - Influencer writes own content based on text/announcement from brand.

With the first option the brand writes the content, and the influencer
has to accept the deal as is. With the second option, the brand writes
the content, but the influencer must rewrite it in their own words and
with the final option the brand only gives instructions to the
influencer on where to write about, this can be an article, product,
event etc.

With the second and third option the brand will be able to review the
content written by the influencer. As soon as both parties agree and
accept the content the deal is final.

The service-budget will be divided over the different options used in
the form. Say you have set 25% of the cards with the first
content-option and 75% with the the second, the budget gets divided
between these accordingly.

### Invite Influencers

Once you have set all cards for a particular service, you'll be able to
invite all influencers matching this service. By clicking on the "Send
Invite" button in the right-menu, all matching influencers will be
invited to perform the selected service.

Because influencers are limited to a fixed number of deals per campaign,
we recommend you to first set the content of all services and combine
the invites of different services (example: like, comment & retweet)
This way the influencer can make a perfect choice on which service they
want to perform.

<div class="thumbnail" width="300" data-align="center" alt="Invite matched influencers" data-show_caption="True" title="">

\_static/images/deals-invite.png

Click on the "Send Invite" button to invite the influencers.

</div>

After you've sent out the invites, the matching influencers will receive
the invitations in their mailbox and as an on-platform notification. The
all the cards have the status "invited"

At this point all you need to do is wait until the budget of the service
is filled with accepted deals.

<div class="thumbnail" width="300" data-align="center" alt="Service deals-progressbar" data-show_caption="True" title="">

\_static/images/deals-progressbar.png

After sending-out the invites you can see how far the budget for each
service is filled.

</div>

### Review content & Accepting deals

In case the brand has created deals where influencers have to write
their own content, the brand will have a chance to review these. Once an
influencer has set the content the deal will be visible under the
"Review" tab. The number in-front of the review-filter shows how many
deals need to be reviewed.

Click on the review-filter and all deals which need to be reviewed are
shown in the grid below. Select the deal which you want to review, and
the content is shown on the right side.

<table style="width:58%;">
<caption>Review Content</caption>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 19%" />
<col style="width: 19%" />
<col style="width: 19%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><blockquote>
<p><img src="_static/images/deals-review-1.png" alt="review1" /></p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p><img src="_static/images/deals-review-2.png" alt="review2" /></p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p><img src="_static/images/deals-review-3.png" alt="review3" /></p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

At the bottom you can Accept the deal, decline the deal, or change the
content. When a brand decides to change the content, any changes made to
the content need be accepted by the influencer first after which the
brand has the final saying.

When both parties agree on the content, the deal is set and will be
scheduled for publication.

### Chat Function

If a campaign is active you can start a private chat with influencers.
This can be useful when the content requires extra information. Just
click on the ![chaticon](_static/images/chat-icon.svg) in the card of
the influencer to start a conversation.

<div class="thumbnail" width="300" data-align="center" alt="Cancel Campaign" data-show_caption="True" title="">

\_static/images/deals-chat.png

When clicking on the ![chaticon](_static/images/chat-icon.svg) in the
deal-cards the chat box opens on the right.

</div>

The chat is only available for influencers with an active status.
(accepted,review,pending,completed) Under the filter "Chat" you can see
if influencers have replied or made a new request.

### Cancel Campaign

In case a brand made a mistake with the set content of any other reason,
he/she can cancel the campaign at any time.

<div class="thumbnail" width="300" data-align="center" alt="Cancel Campaign" data-show_caption="True" title="">

\_static/images/cancel-campaign.png

By clicking on the Cancel button in the campaign-overview, the campaign
will be cancelled immediately.

</div>

All deals which have not been completed yet will be cancelled that
instant and the remaining budget of the campaign reimbursed to the
brand's wallet.
